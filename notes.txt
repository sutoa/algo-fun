1. find sqrt
    a. log solution ans = pow(10, log10(num)/2); this is not a perfect solution; for num = 808201, it does not work due to decimal number
    b. binary search; left, right and everything declared as long; otherwise the product can be negative even if it's declared as long but mid is int
